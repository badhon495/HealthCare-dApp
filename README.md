    ```bash
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    ```
4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Screenshots

### Registration Page (Admin & Doctor)
The landing page of the app where the user can register as an Admin, Doctor, or Patient. Switching the account from MetaMask will change the role of the user. The first account of Ganache is an Admin account. If logged in as the first account, the landing page will directly take you to the Admin dashboard. Change the account to another account from Ganache to see the registration page.
